      "Linen is one of the most biodegradable and stylish fabrics in fashion history! Itâ€™s strong, quick-drying, naturally moth resistant, and made from flax plant fibres. Our linen is certified organic, is farmed using water retting, and, is fully biodegradable. We love linen as a material as with wear and care it becomes softer and more pliable. It basically ages like a fine wine!",
